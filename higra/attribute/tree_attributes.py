    We define the probability :math:`P(\{a,b\})` of a pair of vertices :math:`\{a,b\}` as :math:`w(\{a,b\}) / Z`

    Two sampling strategies are proposed for sampling pairs of vertices to compute the probability of a node of the tree:

    - *edge*: the probability of sampling the pair :math:`\{a, b\}` is given by :math:`P(\{a, b\})`; and
    - *null*: the probability of sampling the pair :math:`\{a, b\}` is given by the product of the probabilities

        (far from the root), as two nodes* :math:`u`, :math:`v` *connected with high weight* :math:`w(\{u, v\})` *in the graph
        typically  belong to a small cluster, representative of the clustering structure of the graph; on the contrary,
        we expect [the null distribution] to be concentrated over shallow nodes (close to the root) as two nodes*
        :math:`w(\{u, v\})` *sampled independently at random typically belong to large clusters, less representative of the
        clustering structure of the graph*. [1]_

    The tree sampling divergence runtime complexity depends of the sampling model:
